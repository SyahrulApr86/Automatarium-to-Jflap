# Automatarium to JFLAP Converter

## Description
This project provides a script for converting Automaton JSON files from [Automatarium](https://automatarium.tdib.xyz) to .jff format files compatible with [JFLAP](http://www.jflap.org/). JFLAP is software used for creating and simulating automata structures, whereas Automatarium is an online platform for designing and sharing automata.

## Motivation
This converter was created based on personal preference for Automatarium over JFLAP, primarily due to Automatarium's better UI and UX. Many users find that assembling machines is more intuitive in Automatarium, offering a better overall experience. However, due to the popularity and use of JFLAP in learning, tools are needed to bridge the gap between these two platforms. This script facilitates the transition, allowing users to design in Automatarium and then export their work to JFLAP for further analysis or instructional purposes.

## Features
- Quick and accurate conversion from JSON to .jff
- Full compatibility with the latest version of JFLAP
- Easy usage with a command-line interface

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
